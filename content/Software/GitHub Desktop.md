GitHub Desktop is a software that greatly simplifies git pulls, pushes, commits, and all that fun stuff. I mostly like using it to organize all of my GitHub projects into one neat folder and be able to easily open repositories with Visual Studio Code, or whatever IDE you prefer to use. (Make sure you're allowed to use any other IDE and if you need a license, request one)

1. To get started installing GitHub Desktop, navigate to [the GitHub Desktop website](https://desktop.github.com/).

2. Click on "Download for Windows" and it should begin downloading the installer

3. Navigate to wherever you downloaded the installer, and run it as an administrator

4. Give the installer administrative privileges by filling out the IT security form

5. The installer will take care of everything. Just let it do its thing!

6. Your first boot will likely look a bit different, but go ahead and login to your GitHub account and, assuming you already [[GitHub||have access to the GitHub organization]], you should be able to get started!
