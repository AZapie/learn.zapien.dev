## • [[Obsidian]]

Obsidian is the markdown editing and viewing software that I have chosen to write these tutorials and tips with. While the software is not open source, it does only use markdown files as pages so it would be very easy to switch to another software. The company also requires that any plugins for the application be open source.

## • Creo [[Creo 6 |6]] & [[Creo 9|9]].

Creo is one of the CAD software used by the mold shop department. Over the years several custom programs have been written by people around the department and interns to help automate or shorten a variety of processes that the engineers do on the day-to-day. For our intents and purposes, we will be installing both [[Creo 6]] and [[Creo 9]]. This is because some of the programs that are written are **dependent** on some API libraries that are installed through the [[Creo 6]] setup process. 

## • [[Visual Studio Code]] - Java

Visual Studio Code, or VSCode is the IDE that I took the initiative to setup for this role. Previously, interns and other programmers were using IntelliJ. I personally don't have anything against that specific IDE, but since we are programming with a commercial intent for a large company; we would be breaking TOS if we used free educational or cheap individual licenses. VSCode doesn't have that problem, as the software is completely free and open source.

## • [[Visual Studio]] - C# 

Visual Studio, not to be confused with VSCode, is another IDE that you'll want to install for this position. This IDE is especially good at handling C# program.
## • [[GitHub]] 

All of the code that you may need to tinker with should be located on [Intralox's New Product Development Github Organization.](https://github.com/NPDSoftwareDev) Specifically, we'll be dealing with the [mold-shop-java repository](https://github.com/NPDSoftwareDev/mold-shop-java) a fair bit.

## • [[GitHub Desktop]]

GitHub desktop is a desktop application made by the people over at GitHub to greatly simplify git clones, pushes, commits, pulls, and all that nice stuff. I'm spoiled by this software as it makes managing a repository in GitHub leagues easier.
