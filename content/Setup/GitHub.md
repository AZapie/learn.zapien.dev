Ah, GitHub. GitHub is far more than just a place to store code, it's an excellent place for teams of programmers to work on a shared project and to be able to store and reference code. For our purposes, we'll mostly be using it to upload our code and track the progress of issues and see how some bugs and errors have been dealt with in the past.

### Getting Access to the GitHub

1. To get started, make sure to head on over to [@Work](https://laitramllc.sharepoint.com/).

5. Click on "Order Now". This will let IT know to purchase a GitHub license so that you can be granted access to the [Intralox NPD organization](https://github.com/NPDSoftwareDev). Keep an eye on your e-mail as you will likely receive something similar to the one pictured below with detailed instructions on who to contact for further assistance.

### Useful GitHub knowledge

The repository that I personally have interacted with the most so far has been [mold-shop-java](https://github.com/NPDSoftwareDev/mold-shop-java). You can view any repositories associated with the engineering mold shop by taking a look at the [mold shop tag](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Amold-shop+org%3ANPDSoftwareDev&type=Repositories) in the GitHub org. Don't get too overwhelmed by all the repositories that exist with that tag. Chances are, you might not have to even think about messing with a fair amount of them.
