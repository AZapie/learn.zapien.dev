This is a living website where I promise I'll avoid blogging, and instead make sure to educate on what I have learned, and pass on that knowledge. Currently I am figuring out how to sync parts of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault to this knowledge database to automate that maintenance portion of things! I could also just work to keep things in seperate vaults, but I haven't decided if that's what I want to do yet.
