# Welcome to Intralox's Engineering Mold Shop Team!

This knowledge database is created by an intern for you, an intern! (Maybe) I'm going to try my best to walk you through all the setup processes so you can be good to go for your first project!

!! Before getting started, head on over to www.obsidian.md and download and setup that software then open the EMS_Intern_Info folder as a vault. Make sure to check out the install & setup tutorial to make sure you did everything right! !!

For a nicer reading experience, click on the open book icon in the top right of Obsidian to swap into reading mode.
### [[Setup_Main |Getting Set Up]]

- This nifty document serves to help you get set up! It links to and goes through guides for installing [[Obsidian]], [[Creo 6]], [[GitHub|Joining the GitHub]], [[Visual Studio Code|Setting up VSCode]], and other stuff. Feel free to start here!
