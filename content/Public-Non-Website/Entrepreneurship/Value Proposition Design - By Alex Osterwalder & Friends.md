### Understanding Customers
Designing good value propositions requires an understanding of the customer's perspective. You can begin to work to understand your customers and their needs by employing the following techniques:
#### The Data Detective: Utilizing Existing Data
A data detective adds onto already existing work with desk research. With the advancement of the internet, it is much easier to research several relevant factors to the customer and their needs. Some examples include:
- Analyzing Google Trends relating to subjects surrounding your customer
- Accessing and recording government data that is readily available and relevant to your objectives.
- Identifying at least three research reports already conducted by a third-party. These can serve as a basis for value proposition research.
##### Social Media Analytics:
Already existing companies should make sure to identify the 'shakers' and the 'movers' related to their image on social media. They should also record the ten most frequently discussed positive and negative topics in regards to them on social media.
##### Customer Relationship Management
A data detective should record the top three most frequent questions, complaints, and requests received from customers.
- Intralox does this by maintaining a close relationship with their customers. For example, with one food-related customer, they are being required to use belts instead of modular conveyers and Intralox does not make belts, but cares about this customer enough and has been requested to make one by the customer *because the customer values the brand's reputation so highly.*
##### Tracking Customers on Website
Note data relating to your website. Especially where internet traffic is coming from as well as where the most popular destinations are. This can help signal that certain products are more sought after but not purchased their impressions to not match the sales numbers.
##### Data Mining
An existing company should always parse through their data to identify patterns that could be useful to any new ideas.
- Think of this like Chris showing you where the old monitor was. The location of the monitor and knowing that there were multiple ones that could be useful for the assigned project is 'data' that at some point Chris took note of. Expanding this to a corporate level can uncover troves of knowledge that could save the company several figures of money and time.

#### The Journalist: Interviewing Customers
A journalist communicates directly with customers to gain insights relevant to the business. A Value Proposition Canvas can be used to prepare for interviews and help tie together masses of information that will be flowing in during an interview. There are seven key steps to this process.

##### Step 1: Creating a customer profile.
- Take note of the jobs, pains, and gains that you believe to summarize the customer you are targeting. Create a priority list of the jobs, pains, and gains.
##### Step 2: Creating an interview outline
- What is it that you're trying to learn from this interview? Build questions based on the created customer profile and ask the customer what they consider their jobs, pains, and gains are and could be.
##### Step 3: Conducting the interview
Follow these ground rules when interviewing the potential customer.
- Listen like a novice. Avoid interrupting the customer's train of thought and make sure to dive into unexpected jobs, pains, or gains.
- Listen more than you talk. You are not there to inform, but to be informed. Time wasted talking about yourself is done so at your expense.
- Seek facts and examples, not opinions. Avoid hypothetical questions and stick to inquiring about past experiences
- Explore the "why?" Understanding the root of everything not only helps you understand the customer's perspective, but also adds an entire layer of context to your goal.
- The interview, again, is to learn. Don't try to sell the customer anything just yet. Instead explore their decision criteria and learn learn what the customer would be willing to or is looking to purchase.
- Don't mention any solutions yet. Ask what their biggest pains are, and analyze if your planned solution will remedy their pains.
- Circle Back! Ask your interviewee for their contact information to establish a continued communicative relationship with them. This will help in the prototype iteration process.
