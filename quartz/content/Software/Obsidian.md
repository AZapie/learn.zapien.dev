[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a very useful writing app that I personally like to use to centralize and document information. Once you get this software set up, you'll (hopefully) see why I chose to centralize all tutorials and useful knowhows using this software.


### Installing & Setting Up Obsidian

1. Start off by going to https://obsidian.md/, you should see a page somewhat like this:

2. Click on the "Get Obsidian for Windows" button. You'll be redirected to the download page

4. Run the installer

5. It should automatically open the app once it's done installing. Upon first boot, it'll prompt you like so:

6. Click on "Open" next to "Open folder as vault". This will prompt you to choose a folder.

7. Navigate to wherever you cloned the repository and choose the folder "EMS_Intern-Info" and open that folder

8. Now go ahead and click on "Select Folder" in the bottom right!

9. Hopefully Obsidian will automatically open the [[Main Page]]. If not, then go ahead and navigate there to get started!
